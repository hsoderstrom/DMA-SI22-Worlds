2. In the window that pops up, click Add Open Scenes and make sure the window "Scenes in build" isn't empty. Make sure your Platform is set to Windows, Mac and Linux and your Target Platform is Windows. 
Then click Build.

3. Create a ***new folder*** for your built game, name it whatever you want and click Select Folder to save it. It will take a minute.

4. Inside the folder you created, there is a file with the same name as your project and the extensions **.exe**. This is your game!

5. Find the folder with your game inside of it (the folder that contains all the files in the image above), right click on it and choose "Send To" -> "Compressed (zipped) folder".
***Do not just zip the .exe file!! We need the entire folder you created when you Built your game!!***
