You will get the best results if you [Build your game](https://github.com/hsoderstrom/DMA-SI22-Worlds/blob/main/BUILD%20&%20SUBMIT%20YOUR%20GAME.md) and take the screenshot while running it. You can do it in the Unity editor too if you crop out the editor windows, but it will be lower quality.

2. This will copy the image onto the clipboard, and then you need to paste it into a Photoshop or Paint document to save it.

3. Save your image as a PNG.
